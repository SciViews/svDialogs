Simple modal dialog boxes are available in R, but they are not implemented on all platforms the same way. In **svDialogs**, we provide functions that operate consistently through all the platforms supported by R, and a fallback mechanisms is also implemented in case no GUI is available (question or menu selection in a textual terminal window).

**TODO: exmplain the bases of svDialogs boxes here...**
