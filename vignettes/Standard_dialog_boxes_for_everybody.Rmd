Simple modal dialog boxes are available in R, but they are not implemented on all platforms the same way. In {svDialogs}, we provide functions that operate consistently through all the platforms supported by R, and a fallback mechanisms is also implemented in case no GUI is available (question or menu selection in a textual terminal window).

**TODO: explain the bases of {svDialogs} boxes here...**
