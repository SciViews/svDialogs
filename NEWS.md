# svDialogs News

## Changes in svDialogs 1.0.0

* Moved to a Github repository.

* snake_case versions of the function names (but camelCase name kept for
  backward compatibility.

* Documentation moved to ROxigen2, tests to testhat (bot no tests yet) and a
  vignette with knitr are added.

* A bug that imposed to load svDialogs on the search path for some dialog boxes
  to be displayed under Windows should be solved.

* RStudio version for many dialog boxes: dir, open (but no multiple selections),
  save, input & message. List dialog box is handled correctly under RStudio,
  although a text version at the R console is used instead (no GUI dialog yet.)


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-59

* `menuAdd()` and similar functions now build a more robust code under
  Unix/Linux for using the `ctxmenu` program. It now uses
  `xvkbd -xsendevent -text` command instead of just `xvkbd -text` that made
  problem on non-US keymap sometimes.

* Entries in the default menu are made more robust: `Load package...` and
  `Install packages...` instructions are simplified, and `R project home page`
  and `CRAN home page` now use `browseURL()` instead of relying on Firefox.

* Added a `Fix()` function in the temporary environment that just duplicate
  `fix()` in case it does not already exists. The menu entry for data edition
  uses it.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-58

* `dlgInput()` returned a strange result in Mac OS X El Captian, due to
  different string formatting of the underlying Mac code.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-57

* Added requirements for Linux (`zenity`) in the `DESCRIPTION` file.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-56

* The native Mac dialogs did not work any more, solved for 10.5 Leopard and
  above by querying the name of the application by its id (Rgui).


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-55

* Rework of `Author` and `Authors@R` fileds in the `DESCRIPTION` file.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-54

* Dependencies to **tcltk** and **svMisc** are eliminated. Consequently, all
  functions that depend on Tcl/Tk are eliminated too. It concerns `guiDlg()`,
  `guiDlgFunction()` and other associated methods or functions. The new
  `dlgForm()`function should be used instead.

* Temporary objects are now saved in `SciViews:TempEnv` instead of `TempEnv`.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-53

* Added support for `JGR` in dialog boxes under Mac OS X.

* The `menuXXX()` functions can manage menus and submenus in `JGR`.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-52

* `menuXXX()` functions do not generate files in `\tmp` dir on Linux, unless in
  `interactive()` session, and with explicit user's acknowledgement. Moreover,
  the user name is not used anymore as part of the name of the temporary menu
  files generated (cf CRAN policies and following B. Ripley's request).

* Code to manage `menuXXX()` items on Mac OS X is considered still experimental
  (on R-forge, not CRAN) and is now commented out. Will be further developed in
  a future version of the **svDialogs** package.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-51

* `NEWS` file reworked to use the new Rd format.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-50

* Slight changes in flexible dialog functions according to notes generated by
  R CMD check (2.15.0), i.e., partial matching of argument env(ir) and use of
  `.Internal` in `eval.with.vis()`; replaced by the actual function
  `withVisible()`.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-49

* Added `dlgForm()` for flexible form dialog box. Only the Linux implementation
  using `yad` and the textual version are currently implemented.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-48

* Argument message is changed to title in `dlgDir()` function, to match
  corresponding argument in `dlgOpen()` and `dlgSave()` and also to indicate it
  can only be a single line of text!

* Added `msgBox()` and `okCancelBox()` function for simpler message box
  handling.

* `dlgOpen()` is now implemented and its `textCLI` version also accepts single
  and double quotes around file path (allow to drag&drop from, e.g., nautilus to
  gnome-terminal in Gnome Linux), on the contrary to `file.choose()`.

* `dlgFilters` is similar to Filters matrix under Windows, and it provides a
  series of default file types and filters for `dlgOpen()` and `dlgSave()`.

* `dlgSave()` is also implemented, but it uses `choose.files()` on Windows,
  which is merely designed to open file(s) instead of providing a file name to
  save to.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-47

* Now, `menuAddItem()` implements `'enable'` and `'disable'` in action to change
  the state of an existing menu item.

* On Windows, using an action as `'enable'` or `'disable'` on nonexisting menus
  just does nothing (on the contrary to the original `winMenuAddItem()` which
  creates that menus with the action being `'enable'`d or `'disable'`d,
  respectively).

* `'$ConsoleMain/<menu>'` is now accepted as a synonym of `'<menu>'` in all
  `menuXXX()` functions, according to corresponding `winMenuXXX()` functions.

* The `menuXXX()` functions now check for bad synthax with the special menus
  `$ConsoleMain`, `$ConsolePopup`, `$Graph<n>Main` and `$Graph<n>Popup:` special
  menu not followed by at least one submenu.

* The console context menu is now implemented too, and `'$ConsolePopup/<menu>'`
  menus allow for adding submenus to it.

* Addition of `menuNames()` and `menuItems()`, working the same way as
  `winMenuNames()` and `winMenuItems()` under Windows.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-46

* The functions to handle menus in Linux are completely rewritten to use a menu
  configuration file that a modified version of `myGtkMenu` (named `ctxmenu`)
  can read and interpret to display the corresponding menus.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-45

* Similar custom menus as `winMenuXXX()` functions are added and allow to add
  custom menus on the Mac (both `R.app` and `terminal`) and for R run on a
  Gnome desktop, providing the system is configured to manage such menus,
  see `?menuAdd`.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-44

* The `guiDlgXXX()` functions are reworked into S3 methods and their interface
  changes. To avoid any confusion, they are renamed `dlgXXX()`.

* `dlgMessage()` is reworked into native dialog box, but it looses a couple
  of options during the process (title, icon, parent). The previous code is now
  moved to **svDialogstcltk**.

* `dlgInput()` is reworked the same way, and it looses the `parent=` argument
  that was not implemented yet, anyway, and the `title=` argument that is now
  always `"question"` in order to match `winDialogString()` function on Windows.

* `dlgList()` is also refactored that way. Its interface is completely changed
  to better match the arguments of `select.list()` and to make it a direct
  replacement for that function.

* `dlgDir()` is completely rewritten, as well as, `dlgOpen()` and `dlgSave()`.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-43

* **tcltk** R package is moved from `depends` to `imports`.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-42

* `guiDlgFun()` is adapted to the new help system provided in R 2.10.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-41

* When the path contained spaces, `guiDlgOpen()` and `guiDlgSave()` returned
  them in pieces.


## Changes in svDialogs 0.9-40

This is the first version distributed on R-forge. It is completely refactored
from older versions (on CRAN since 2003) to make it run with **SciViews-K** and
**Komodo Edit** (**SciViews-R Console** not supported any more).
