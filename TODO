= svDialogs To Do list

* Create as many tests (testthat) as possible, given most of the code is
  supposed to be used interactively, and thus, is not (easily) testable
  automatically.

* A complete vignette, with rationate, explanation of mechanism to dispatch
  dialog boxes, example of input dialog box on all supported platforms, and
  further explanation for all supported dialog boxes.

* Reexpose useful svGUI functions.

* Find a solution for dlg_open(multiple = TRUE) on RStudio (not supported yet).

* Find a better solution for textual dlg_open(multiple = TRUE): allow for
  globbing and for folder indication followed by a list selector of files in
  that directory that match filters.

* Manage filters = for dlg_open()/dlg_save().

* Find a better solution for dlg_message(type = "yesnocancel") on RStudio (since
  I can only display two button, we first ask 'yes'/'no', then ask to confirm).
  This is the same with zenity, but since yad is advised on Linux, we don't care
  much.

* Menus for MacOS, RStudio, and RTerm.exe under Windows.

* dlg_form() for MacOS, Windows and RStudio, as well as, a better text version.

* For MacOS one can also use:
  - osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to choose color default color
  {12, 56, 78}' # Warning: 0-65535!

* rstudioapi provides askForPassword() => implement it, including other versions
  (use a yad form in Linux).

* Translation into different languages.
