= svDialogs To Do list

* Find a solution for dlg_open(multiple = TRUE) on RStudio (not supported yet).

* Find a better solution for textual dlg_open(multiple = TRUE): allow for
  globbing and for folder indication followed by a list selector of files in
  that directory that match filters.

* Find a better solution for dlg_message(type = "yesnocancel") on RStudio (since
  I can only display two button, we first ask 'yes'/'no', then ask to confirm).
  This is the same with zenity, but since yad is advised on Linux, we don't care
  much.

* Fix messages where there are single or double quotes (' to be replaced by \\')

* Menus for MacOS, RStudio, and RTerm.exe under Windows

* dlgForm for MacOS, Windows and RStudio

* For MacOS one can also use:
  - osascript -e 'tell application "Terminal" to choose color default color
  {12, 56, 78}' # Warning: 0-65535!

* rstudioapi provides askForPassword() => implement it, including other versions
  (use a yad form in Linux).

* Translation into different languages.
